Exactly! The simplest usage is just:

But you can optionally add:

The system automatically handles:

âœ… UUID generation
âœ… Timestamp creation
âœ… Activation setting (starts at 1.0)
âœ… Decay rate (default value)
âœ… Storage (RAM + disk)
âœ… Indexing (content, tags, type)
âœ… Version management
For relationships, you can optionally link:

That's it! Three parameters maximum:

content (required)
tags (optional - helps with search)
node_type (optional - helps with organization)
Everything else is automated. The system will automatically:

Find related memories during recall
Apply neural-inspired spreading activation
Handle temporal decay
Manage storage efficiently
Build search indexes
Boom! ðŸ’¥ Simple as that.
